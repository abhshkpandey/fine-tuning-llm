## LLaMA 2 Fine-Tuning with Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`llama_2_fine_tuning.ipynb`) to guide you through fine-tuning the LLaMA 2 large language model (LLM). 

**Before you begin:**

*  **LLaMA 2 Access:** You'll need access to the LLaMA 2 model weights and tokenizer. This requires filling out a form on Meta's platform and agreeing to the license terms [https://llama.meta.com/llama-downloads/](https://llama.meta.com/llama-downloads/).
*  **Hugging Face Account:**  Create a Hugging Face account ([https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/)) and obtain an API token.
*  **Hardware:** While the notebook utilizes QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning on a single GPU, having multiple GPUs or a TPU can significantly improve training speed.

**Requirements:**

* Python (tested with 3.8+)
* Libraries:
    * `transformers`
    * `datasets`
    * `qlora`
    * `numpy`
    * (Optional for GPU acceleration) `torch`
    
These can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets qlora numpy torch  # Optional: torch for GPU
```

**Instructions:**

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the required libraries (mentioned above).
3.  Download the LLaMA 2 model weights and tokenizer following the instructions on Meta's platform. Place them in a directory accessible by the notebook.
4.  Open `llama_2_fine_tuning.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook environment.
5.  Update the notebook with your desired fine-tuning parameters (dataset, hyperparameters, etc.).
6.  Run the notebook cells to fine-tune the LLaMA 2 model.

**Note:**

* Fine-tuning LLMs can be computationally expensive. Ensure you have sufficient resources for training.
* The provided notebook is a basic example. You can modify it to suit your specific needs.
